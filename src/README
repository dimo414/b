Version 0.5.0 - Feature Complete Beta

Introduction:

Based off and built using Steve Losh's brilliantly simple task manager t
(http://stevelosh.com/projects/t/) the fundamental principle is 
'Get things done, not organized', and tries to follow t's motto,
"the only way to make your bug list prettier is to fix some damn bugs."

That said, HgBugs has many powerful additions to t, without any of the bloat
and burden of setting up, maintaining, or using a traditional bug tracker.

You can use HgBugs exactly like t, add, rename, resolve, and list work almost
exactly like t out of the box, with the added benefit that wherever you are in
a repository, you maintain a single bugs database in the root of the repository.

But you can do more with HgBugs.  You can reopen issues - a feature starkly
lacking from t.  The edit, details, and comment commands allow you to track
additional information about the bugs, like stack traces and expected results,
and whatever other information you'd like.  The details file is a plain text
file, and can contain any content you desire.

You can also assign bugs to specific individuals - either based on their
commit names or not - and list lets you filter by owner to see what tasks
are in your care.

HgBugs is powerful enough to support several different workflow complexities,
from an individual just tracking tasks in a repository, all the way up to a
small, distributed team of managers and developers who need to be able to
report, manage, and assign bugs, tasks, and issues, share details, and
express their opinions.

However, HgBugs is not intended to be be a replacement for large scale
bug trackers like Jira, Bugzilla, and the upcoming Bugs Everywhere.  Most
notably, (at present) HgBugs is just a command line tool.  There is no
centralized bug list or web access, nor any GUI interface, and many of the
features in such larger projects are lacking, notably any kind of warning or
notification when a bug is reassigned, and the ability to categorize bugs and
to provide resolution reasons, like fixed or duplicate - of course these could
all be done manually, but there is no such built in functionality.

If you find many of those extra features to be unhelpful bloat when you're
trying to keep track of your smaller projects, and you don't care to waste
time organizing, categorizing, and sorting however, HgBugs is the tool to use!
