Version 0.5.0 - Feature Complete Beta

Introduction:

Based off and built using Steve Losh's brilliantly simple task manager t
(http://stevelosh.com/projects/t/) the fundamental principle is 
'Get things done, not organized', and tries to follow t's motto,
"the only way to make your bug list prettier is to fix some damn bugs."

That said, HgBugs has many powerful additions to t, without any of the bloat
and burden of setting up, maintaining, or using a traditional bug tracker.

You can use HgBugs exactly like t, add, rename, resolve, and list work almost
exactly like t out of the box, with the added benefit that wherever you are in
a repository, you maintain a single bugs database in the root of the repository.

But you can do more with HgBugs.  You can reopen issues - a feature starkly
lacking from t.  The edit, details, and comment commands allow you to track
additional information about the bugs, like stack traces and expected results,
and whatever other information you'd like.  The details file is a plain text
file, and can contain any content you desire.

You can also assign bugs to specific individuals - either based on their
commit names or not - and list lets you filter by owner to see what tasks
are in your care.

HgBugs is powerful enough to support several different workflow complexities,
from an individual just tracking tasks in a repository, all the way up to a
small, distributed team of managers and developers who need to be able to
report, manage, and assign bugs, tasks, and issues, share details, and
express their opinions.

However, HgBugs is not intended to be be a replacement for large scale
bug trackers like Jira, Bugzilla, and the upcoming Bugs Everywhere.  Most
notably, (at present) HgBugs is just a command line tool.  There is no
centralized bug list or web access, nor any GUI interface, and many of the
features in such larger projects are lacking, notably any kind of warning or
notification when a bug is reassigned, and the ability to categorize bugs and
to provide resolution reasons, like fixed or duplicate - of course these could
all be done manually, but there is no such built in functionality.

If you find many of those extra features to be unhelpful bloat when you're
trying to keep track of your smaller projects, and you don't care to waste
time organizing, categorizing, and sorting however, HgBugs is the tool to use!


Some Suggested Use Cases:

A single developer, working on a small project, can turn that into a version
controlled project with a simple 'hg init', and with HgBugs, he (or she) also
gets a fully functional bug tracker to boot, no additional setup required!

Working on a website, you could very easily (and I might do this myself 
soon enough) write a little PHP script which takes bug reports and logs 
them to HgBugs.  I often find the closer to where my workflow a tool is
is the easier it is to use, so integrating it right into the website
makes a lot of sense.

Working on a small project with a few other team members is ideal for HgBugs,
it's powerful enough to let everyone track what they need to do, and allow
everyone to contribute what they can to any of the bugs on file.  They can
search titles for matching bugs, and even grep through the details directory
to find details matching what they're looking for.

Working on a larger project with lots of team members starts getting questionable,
as many of the powerful features larger projects provide start to really show
their worth.  However in my experience serveral large companies I've worked for
or with have drastically underutilized the power of their bug trackers, to the 
point where all the complexity and extra metadata is just wasted space and fluff.
That's not to say that HgBugs is necessarily a good alternative for a large company,
especially if you deny your employees access to anything they don't need-to-know
distributed version control, and therefore HgBugs is certainly not for you.
But it's worth asking yourself if you really benefit from all the extra tools;
many companies could get by just fine with the features HgBugs provides.
