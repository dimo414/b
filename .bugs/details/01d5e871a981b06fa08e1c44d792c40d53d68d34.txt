[details]
Currently, when you run "hg b edit" for a bug that doesn't yet have a details
file, it creates a new file based on a static template hardcoded within the
extension's implementation.  While that can remain the default behavior, I'm
sure that in some cases, an alternate template would be desirable.  I propose
that if a "newdetails.txt" file exists in the bugsdir, its contents will be
used as the template instead of the default.  This allows customizations such
as addition/removal of sections, additions/removal of comments, or even trivial
changes such as addition of a trailing newline.

Instead of hardcoding the path "newdetails.txt", it could be a default as well.
The addition of a bugs.newdetails configuration option, interpreted as a path
relative to the bugsdir would allow users control over the structure of the
directory, or possibly overriding the default for a repository by specifying
an alternate path or absolute path.
