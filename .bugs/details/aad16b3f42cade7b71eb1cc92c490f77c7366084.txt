When I use b with ``EDITOR=emacsclient --tty``, it fails with \"abort: No such file or directory\".
I think b is executing the editor command with space, where it should be with an argument \"--tty\".
It works with ``EDITOR=emacsclient``.

The naive solution obviously doesn't work, but the shlex module should offer more robust support:

Resolving by swapping the subprocess call to use shell=True, rather than attempting manual splitting.
