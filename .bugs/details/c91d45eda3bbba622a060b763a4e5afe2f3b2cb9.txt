If you run "hg b edit ID" to edit a bug, and then close the editor without
changing anything, that should result in no change in state in the working
copy, similar to how an "hg commit" followed by not saving any changes aborts
the commit.  Otherwise, running "hg b edit" on a couple tickets that don't
already have details and then changing your mind leaves you with newly added
template detail files that don't add any value, and require cleaning up if
you don't want to commit them.
