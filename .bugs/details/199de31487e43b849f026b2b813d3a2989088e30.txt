Mercurial supports a --template option for many commands, and there are plans
to add this support to all commands.  I'd like to see something similar
supported within b.  The command that it would be most useful for would be
b list, since it's clearly output-oriented.  The main usecases that I'm wishing
for are: 

"[{status}] {id|shortbid} - {title}\n"
"{date|shortdate} {id|shortbid} - {title}\n"

The first would be used for a list of all issues (assuming that the feature
request in #66b46dc4 is implemented) and the second would be used to include
the date of the bug's creation in the listing, especially when listing
chronologically.

If possible, it would be desirable to support all installed Mercurial keyword
filters.

Further thought would need to be given into what keywords make sense to
support.  Here's one possible proposal:

date: Date information. The date when the bug was created. This could be used
    with the age filter or various other date formatting filters.
details: String. The contents of the details file for the bug, if it exists.
    Comment lines and sections without content are stripped, as they would be
    in the output of hg b details.
id: The full ID of the bug.  It might be useful to provide a 'shortbid' filter
    to change this to a prefix of the ID, such as the first 8 characters.  For
    display purposes, fixed lengths often work better than variable lengths.
owner: String. The current owner of the bug.
status: String. Either 'Open' or 'Resolved'.  It might be useful to provide a
    'shortbstatus' filter (similar to shortbisect) that changes this into a
    single character, either 'O' or 'R'.
title: String. The name/title of the bug.

All of these except for title can be satisfied based solely on data in the bugs
file.  If adding the details token increased the complexity, I think it would be
fine to omit it; I'm not sure it's really that useful.
