Implemented revision selection by running 'hg cat -r X' on the necessary files in the .bugs directory and exporting them to a temporary directory.  The extension is then pointed to that temporary directory as the bugs db, and commands are run as normal.  Only the read-only commands specified above can be run against old revisions.
