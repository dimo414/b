[details]
My editor is defined in .hgrc as 'vim -c "set tw=76"'.  The `editor.split()`
call in `edit` splits that into ['vim', '-c', '"set', 'tw=76"'].  This cases
vim to open two files, one named 'tw=76"' and the real bug file.  Instead,
`edit` should split the string into ['vim', '-c', 'set tw=76'].

[expected]
vim should open only the bug file


[actual]
vim opens 'tw=76"' plus the bug file


[reproduce]
env EDITOR='vim -c "set tw=76"' hg b add foo -e
