I was working on porting the existing issues for a small project over to b.
I added the tickets, and then I was going to assign 3 tickets to myself.  The
command I expected to enter was "hg b assign me ID ID ID".  However, it looks
like currently, the ID has to come first, and only one is supported per
invocation.
